				<h1>The Jar of Pebbles: A Guide to What Truly Matters</h1>
				<p>
					Imagine life as a jar. No, not for storing cookies or hiding your secret chocolate stash. This jar
					is symbolic, representing everything that makes up your life. Every day, we decide what to put into
					this jar — responsibilities, hobbies, relationships, and, of course,dreams.
				</p>

				<p>
					But here's the catch — the jar isn’t infinite. You can’t just keep stuffing things in and hope it
					won’t overflow. Prioritizing what you put into your jar is the secret to a fulfilling and meaningful
					life.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, how do you decide? Let’s break it down step-by-step, starting with the big stuff — the pebbles.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div id="pebbles" class="container">
				<h2>The Big Things: Pebbles</h2>
				<p>
					<span>Pebbles symbolize the essential, non-negotiable aspects of life.</span> These are the people,
					passions, and values that give life meaning and bring genuine happiness. Think of them as the sturdy
					rocks that form the foundation of your existence.
				</p>
				<h3>Examples of Pebbles</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Family and Loved Ones</span>Late-night heart-to-hearts, silly family traditions, and
							unconditional support.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Health</span>It’s easier to chase dreams when you’re not chasing after your lost
							breath.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Friendships</span>The people who know your embarrassing stories and still choose to
							hang out with you.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Purpose and Passions</span>Whether it's creating, teaching, dancing, or gardening,
							passions keep your spirit alive.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<span>Key Lesson:</span> Without pebbles, your life may feel hollow, no matter how full your
					calendar looks.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div id="peas" class="container">
				<h2>The Important But Replaceable Things: Peas</h2>
				<p>
					Next up, we have the peas. <span>Think of them as the second layer in your jar.</span> Peas
					represent the practical, necessary things that make life comfortable. They matter, but they’re not
					the reason you jump out of bed in the morning.
				</p>
				<h3>Examples of Peas</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Your Job</span>It pays the bills, funds your coffee obsession, and maybe even gets you
							a shiny toaster.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Money </span>You need it, but it’s not the only thing that makes life good.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Your Phone </span>Super useful, but you won’t look back and cherish the hours spent
							doom-scrolling.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<span>Key Lesson:</span> Peas are valuable but replaceable. Losing one might sting, but it won't
					leave your jar empty.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div id="send" class="container">
				<h2>The Small Stuff: Sand</h2>
				<p>
					Now, the sneaky part — the sand. <span>Sand represents all the minor distractions and
						pleasures</span> that easily consume your time. They might feel important in the moment, but too
					much sand leaves no room for pebbles.
				</p>
				<h3>Examples of Sand</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Scrolling Through Social Media</span>"Just five more minutes" somehow turns into two
							hours of memes.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Binge-Watching TV Shows or serials</span>That one episode cliffhanger? The ultimate
							test of willpower.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<span>Mindless Online Shopping</span>Suddenly you own a glow-in-the-dark cat sweater. No
							regrets.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<span>Key Lesson:</span> Sand is fine in moderation. But if you fill your jar with it first, there
					won’t be space for what really matters.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div id="beer" class="container">
				<h2>The Beer Surprise</h2>
				<p>
					Just when it seems the jar is full, there’s always room for one last surprise. In this case,
					<span>it’s beer</span>. Yes, the wise professor from the original story topped off the jar with a
					cold beverage, proving a simple yet delightful point.
				</p>
				<h3>The Lesson of the Beer</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>No Matter How Busy Life Gets, There’s Always Room for Fun.</li>
					<li>Moments with Friends Make Life Sweeter.</li>
					<li>Laughter and Relaxation Are Essential.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					<span>Key Lesson:</span> Prioritizing joy makes everything else more bearable.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div id="happiness" class="container">
				<h2>Finding Happiness: Family, Passion, and Purpose</h2>
				<p>
					Ultimately, a well-balanced jar leads to happiness. But what truly makes people happy? — It’s not
					endless social media scrolling.
				</p>

				<p>
					Family, genuine connections, and meaningful work create lasting joy. Family dinners filled with
					laughter, children’s giggles, and shared traditions form memories that outshine fleeting pleasures.
				</p>

				<p>
					Pursuing your passion, whether it’s art, teaching, or coding, brings purpose and satisfaction. And
					when you dedicate time to your passions, even the hardest days become rewarding.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Key Lesson:</span> True happiness isn’t about avoiding the hard stuff. It’s about cherishing
					the pebbles that make life meaningful.
				</p>
			</div>


			<div id="homework" class="container">
				<h2>Why is homework so important?</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<span>It Builds Discipline: </span> Completing assignments teaches you to stay
						focused, meet deadlines, and solve problems — all vital skills in any career.
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>It Enhances Knowledge:</span> Each task strengthens your understanding of
						subjects, making you better prepared for real-world challenges.
					<li>
						<span>It Develops Critical Thinking:</span> Homework often pushes you to think
						creatively and find solutions, a skill that employers value.
					</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Example:</h3>

				<!-- Homework from Yevhen -->
				<div class="homework-task">
					<p class="text-bold">
						Maecenas lacinia felis nec placerat sollicitudin. Quisque placerat dolor at scelerisque
						imperdiet. Phasellus tristique felis dolor.
					</p>
					<p>
						Maecenas elementum in risus sed condimentum. Duis convallis ante ac tempus maximus. Fusce
						malesuada sed velit ut dictum. Morbi faucibus vitae orci at euismod. Integer auctor augue in
						erat vehicula, quis fermentum ex finibus.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mauris pretium elit a dui pulvinar, in ornare sapien euismod. Nullam interdum nisl ante, id
						feugiat quam euismod commodo. Sed ultrices lectus ut iaculis rhoncus. Aenean non dignissim
						justo, at fermentum turpis. Sed molestie, ligula ut molestie ultrices, tellus ligula viverra
						neque, malesuada consectetur diam sapien volutpat risus.
						Quisque eget tortor lobortis, facilisis metus eu, elementum est. Nunc sit amet erat quis ex
						convallis suscipit. ur ridiculus mus.

				<p>
					Life isn’t about cramming in as much as possible. It’s about choosing what fills your jar
					wisely.<br>
					Start with your pebbles — your health, loved ones, and passions. Add the peas, the necessary but
					replaceable things. Let the sand settle in, enjoying life’s small pleasures in moderation. And
					remember the beer — laughter and connection will always find space.
				</p>
				<p>
					So, what will you put in your jar today?
