								<p>
									Once upon a time, in a hot, dry desert, lived a cactus named Captain Spike.
									He was round, green, and very proud of his sharp and shiny needles.
								</p>
								<p>
									Captain Spike had two best friends:
									– Lola, a tall skinny cactus who loved to dance in the wind,
									– and Tiny, a baby cactus who was afraid of <a class="story__link" href="#">
										butterflies</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									One day, Captain Spike found a strange thing in the sand.
									It was big, green, and round — just like him!
									He shouted, “Oh no! A twin? Am I not special anymore?!”
								</p>
								<p>
									Lola looked closer and said, “No, silly! That’s a watermelon!”
								</p>
								<p>
									Captain Spike got very excited.
									“Great! Let’s open it and have a party!”
								</p>
								<p>
									But... there was a problem.
									None of them had hands. Or teeth. Or a knife. 😅
								</p>
								<p>
									They all stared at the watermelon. The watermelon stared back (well, maybe).
									Tiny said, “Maybe if we roll on it, it will open!”
								</p>
								<p>
									So they rolled. And rolled. And rolled...
									But the watermelon did not open. Instead, Tiny got stuck inside a tumbleweed.
								</p>
								<p>
									“Oh no! Tiny is gone!” cried Lola.
								</p>
								<p>
									Captain Spike had an idea. “Let’s ask the desert owl. He is very wise.”
								</p>
								<p>
									The owl flew down, looked at the watermelon, and said:
									“You are cactuses. You don’t eat watermelon. You store water! You are the water!”
								</p>
								<p>
									Everyone was quiet.
								</p>
								<p>
									Then Captain Spike said, “That’s the saddest party ever.”
								</p>
								<p>
									But the owl smiled. “Not if you dance!”
								</p>
								<p>
									So that night, under the stars, the cactuses danced around the watermelon.
									Tiny got out of the tumbleweed, and even the owl joined the fun.
								</p>
								<p>
									And from that day, the desert had a new rule: No hands, no problem — just dance!
									💃🌵🕺
